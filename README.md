# TestApi
Thank you for taking the time to explore this repository. 

As stated in the Swagger UI located [here](https://swcoretestapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html). This code is not intended to be production-ready. There are a number of shortcuts and a certain lack of adherence to architectural principles. In my defense, this API is intended more to show my C# skill set rather than my understanding of application architecture. It will be used as the backend for a number of potential frontend tech stacks. The purpose of which is to keep my skills set current and to improve them as I pursue employment opportunities.

That said, I think it might be important to give an overview of what I did and why.
